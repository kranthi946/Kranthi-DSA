Here are short notes on **String**, **StringBuilder**, and **StringBuffer** in Java:

### 1. **String**:
- **Immutable**: Once a `String` object is created, its value cannot be changed. Any operation that modifies a string (like concatenation or substring) creates a **new String object**.
- **Memory Overhead**: Since strings are immutable, creating many modified strings can result in higher memory usage and performance overhead (due to the creation of new objects).
- **Thread-Safety**: `String` objects are **immutable**, which means they are inherently thread-safe. Multiple threads can safely use the same `String` without synchronization.
- **Usage**: Preferred when you need to handle text that doesn't change frequently or when thread safety is a concern.

  **Example**:
  ```java
  String s = "Hello";
  s = s + " World";  // A new String object is created, "Hello World"
  ```

### 2. **StringBuilder**:
- **Mutable**: Unlike `String`, `StringBuilder` objects are mutable. You can modify the contents of a `StringBuilder` without creating new objects.
- **Performance**: `StringBuilder` is generally **faster** than using `String` for repeated concatenations, as it doesn't create a new object each time. The internal character array is resized as needed.
- **Thread-Safety**: `StringBuilder` is **not thread-safe**. If you need to use a `StringBuilder` object in a multi-threaded environment, you must manually synchronize it or use `StringBuffer`.
- **Usage**: Ideal for scenarios where strings need to be modified (e.g., inside loops) and thread safety is not a concern.

  **Example**:
  ```java
  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
  sb.append(" World");  // No new object created, modifies the existing StringBuilder
  ```

### 3. **StringBuffer**:
- **Mutable**: Like `StringBuilder`, `StringBuffer` is mutable, so it allows modification of the string without creating new objects.
- **Performance**: `StringBuffer` is slightly slower than `StringBuilder` because of the synchronization overhead. It ensures thread safety, meaning that multiple threads can safely modify the same `StringBuffer` object.
- **Thread-Safety**: `StringBuffer` is **thread-safe**. All its methods are synchronized, meaning only one thread can access the method at a time. This ensures that multiple threads can modify a `StringBuffer` without causing data corruption.
- **Usage**: `StringBuffer` is used when thread safety is required in a multi-threaded environment (although `StringBuilder` is generally preferred if thread safety is not an issue).

  **Example**:
  ```java
  StringBuffer sbf = new StringBuffer("Hello");
  sbf.append(" World");  // Modifies the existing StringBuffer object in a thread-safe manner
  ```

### Comparison of String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer:

| Feature              | **String**                       | **StringBuilder**                | **StringBuffer**                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Immutability**      | Immutable                        | Mutable                          | Mutable                         |
| **Thread Safety**     | Thread-safe (due to immutability) | Not thread-safe                  | Thread-safe (synchronized methods) |
| **Performance**       | Slower due to new object creation| Faster for concatenation         | Slower than `StringBuilder` due to synchronization |
| **Usage**             | For fixed or infrequently changed text | For text modification without thread safety concern | For thread-safe text modifications |
| **Best Use Case**     | When text does not change often | When text needs frequent modification in a single thread | When text needs frequent modification and thread safety is required |

### Key Takeaways:
- **String**: Best for immutable text.
- **StringBuilder**: Best for mutable text in a **single-threaded** environment due to better performance.
- **StringBuffer**: Best for mutable text in a **multi-threaded** environment, although itâ€™s slower than `StringBuilder` because of synchronization overhead.
