Sure! Here's the complete code snippet that covers all the key concepts related to string literals, string pooling, and `new String()` behavior. The code demonstrates the differences between string literals, string pool usage, and new string objects created with `new String()`, and also compares references and contents of the strings.

### Complete Code Snippet:

```java
package org.example;

public class Strings {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // String literals and new string object
        String s1 = "code";  // String literal
        String s3 = "code";  // Another reference to the same string literal
        String s2 = new String("code"); // String object created with 'new'

        // Print the identity hash codes (this simulates the address in memory)
        System.out.println("HashCode of s1 (string literal): " + System.identityHashCode(s1));
        System.out.println("HashCode of s3 (string literal): " + System.identityHashCode(s3));
        System.out.println("HashCode of s2 (new string object): " + System.identityHashCode(s2));

        // Compare references (==) to check if they point to the same object
        System.out.println("\ns1 == s2: " + (s1 == s2));  // false, different objects
        System.out.println("s1 == s3: " + (s1 == s3));  // true, same object in the pool

        // Compare content using equals() to check if their values are the same
        System.out.println("\ns1.equals(s2): " + s1.equals(s2));  // true, same content
        System.out.println("s1.equals(s3): " + s1.equals(s3));  // true, same content

        // Explanation of String Pool behavior
        System.out.println("\nExplanation:");
        System.out.println("1. String literals (e.g., 'code') are stored in the string constant pool.");
        System.out.println("2. If the string already exists in the pool, Java reuses it for any subsequent string literals with the same value.");
        System.out.println("3. Using 'new String()' creates a new object on the heap, even if the content is identical.");
        System.out.println("4. String pooling ensures memory optimization by reusing identical string literals.");
        System.out.println("5. The comparison with '==' checks if two references point to the same object in memory.");
        System.out.println("6. The '.equals()' method compares the content of two strings, not their memory locations.");
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **String Literals (`s1` and `s3`)**:
   - `s1` and `s3` are both assigned the string literal `"code"`. Since string literals are interned, both `s1` and `s3` point to the same object in the string pool.

2. **New String Object (`s2`)**:
   - `s2` is created using `new String("code")`, which forces the creation of a new object on the heap. This is a separate object from the one in the string pool, even though it contains the same content.

3. **Identity Hash Code**:
   - The `System.identityHashCode()` method prints the hash code (which simulates the "address" or identity) of each string. This helps us understand if two variables point to the same object in memory.

4. **Reference Comparison (`==`)**:
   - `==` compares whether two references point to the **same memory location** (i.e., the same object). The comparison `s1 == s3` returns `true` because both refer to the same string literal in the pool. `s1 == s2` returns `false` because `s2` is a new object on the heap.

5. **Content Comparison (`.equals()`)**:
   - `.equals()` compares the **content** of two strings. Since the content of `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` is the same (`"code"`), `.equals()` returns `true` for both comparisons (`s1.equals(s2)` and `s1.equals(s3)`).

### Expected Output:

```
HashCode of s1 (string literal): 1848295844
HashCode of s3 (string literal): 1848295844
HashCode of s2 (new string object): 1458274841

s1 == s2: false
s1 == s3: true

s1.equals(s2): true
s1.equals(s3): true

Explanation:
1. String literals (e.g., 'code') are stored in the string constant pool.
2. If the string already exists in the pool, Java reuses it for any subsequent string literals with the same value.
3. Using 'new String()' creates a new object on the heap, even if the content is identical.
4. String pooling ensures memory optimization by reusing identical string literals.
5. The comparison with '==' checks if two references point to the same object in memory.
6. The '.equals()' method compares the content of two strings, not their memory locations.
```

### Key Takeaways:

1. **String Pooling**: String literals are stored in the string constant pool, and the same literal is reused to save memory. `s1` and `s3` refer to the same object in the pool.

2. **New String Object**: Using `new String("code")` creates a new object on the heap, even though its content is identical to the string in the pool. `s2` is a different object from `s1` and `s3`.

3. **Reference Comparison (`==`)**: This compares the **memory locations** (or object identity). `s1` and `s3` are the same object in memory, but `s2` is a different object.

4. **Content Comparison (`.equals()`)**: This compares the **content** of the strings (i.e., the actual string values). In this case, all strings have the same content ("code").

This snippet should give you a good understanding of how string interning and memory optimization work with string literals and the `new String()` constructor in Java.
