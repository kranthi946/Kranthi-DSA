You're absolutely right! When you perform a string concatenation like `s1 = s1 + "kranthi";`, it will create a **new String object** in memory, even if the concatenation result is identical in content. This is an important aspect of how string concatenation works in Java.

Let me break down what happens in the scenario where you do this:

### String Concatenation Behavior in Java:
1. **String Literals** (`s1 = "code";` and `s3 = "code";`):
   - Both `s1` and `s3` initially refer to the same string literal `"code"` in the **string constant pool (SCP)**.
   - String literals are interned, meaning they are stored in the string pool, and if a literal string is already present in the pool, any subsequent references to that string will point to the same object in the pool.

2. **String Concatenation (`s1 = s1 + "kranthi";`)**:
   - When you concatenate `s1 + "kranthi"`, a **new string object** is created because strings in Java are **immutable**. This means the value of `s1` itself cannot be changed. Instead, a new string is created and assigned to `s1`.
   - The resulting string, `"codekranthi"`, is **not automatically interned** (i.e., it is not placed in the string constant pool), and a new string object will be created in the heap memory.

3. **Interning the Result (`intern()`)**:
   - After concatenation, the string `"codekranthi"` will **not automatically** be added to the string constant pool, but if you call `s1.intern()`, it will check if the string `"codekranthi"` already exists in the pool. If it does not, it will be added.

4. **Why a New Object Is Created**:
   - Even though you started with a string literal `"code"` and concatenated another string to it, the **concatenation results in a new object** that points to a new memory location. Therefore, the reference `s1` after concatenation will point to a **new object** that is different from the one in the constant pool.

### Complete Code Example:

```java
package org.example;

public class Strings {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // String literals
        String s1 = "code";  // String literal
        String s3 = "code";  // Another reference to the same string literal

        // Concatenating s1 with another string
        s1 = s1 + "kranthi"; // String concatenation, creates a new object

        // Print the identity hash codes (this simulates the address in memory)
        System.out.println("HashCode of s1 (after concatenation): " + System.identityHashCode(s1));
        System.out.println("HashCode of s3 (string literal): " + System.identityHashCode(s3));

        // Compare references (==) to check if they point to the same object
        System.out.println("\ns1 == s3: " + (s1 == s3));  // false, different objects

        // Compare content using equals() to check if their values are the same
        System.out.println("\ns1.equals(s3): " + s1.equals(s3));  // true, same content

        // Demonstrate the effect of string interning
        String s4 = s1.intern();  // Interns the string s1 (puts it in the string pool)

        // HashCode after interning (s4 should now point to the interned version)
        System.out.println("\nHashCode of s4 (after intern()): " + System.identityHashCode(s4));

        // Check if interned version is the same as the original string literal
        System.out.println("\ns4 == s3 (after interning): " + (s4 == s3));  // true, same object in the pool
    }
}
```

### Expected Output:

```
HashCode of s1 (after concatenation): 123456789
HashCode of s3 (string literal): 1848295844

s1 == s3: false

s1.equals(s3): true

HashCode of s4 (after intern()): 1848295844

s4 == s3 (after interning): true
```

### Explanation of Output:
1. **Hash Code Differences**:
   - After `s1 = s1 + "kranthi";`, the **hash code of `s1`** is different from the hash code of `s3`. This is because the concatenation creates a new `String` object that is different from the string literal `"code"`, and that new object is not interned by default.
   - `s3` remains pointing to the original string literal `"code"` in the string constant pool.

2. **Reference Comparison (`==`)**:
   - `s1 == s3` is `false` because after concatenation, `s1` refers to a **new string object** (`"codekranthi"`) created at runtime, while `s3` still refers to the string literal `"code"` in the string constant pool.

3. **Content Comparison (`.equals()`)**:
   - `s1.equals(s3)` is `true` because the content of `s1` (`"codekranthi"`) is equal to the content of `s3` (`"code"`), even though they are different objects.

4. **Interning (`.intern()`)**:
   - After calling `s1.intern()`, the string `"codekranthi"` is interned into the string pool, and `s4` will now point to the **same object** as `s3` in the pool (if `"codekranthi"` already exists, or it will be added if not).
   - After interning, `s4 == s3` is `true` because both `s4` and `s3` now refer to the same interned object in the string constant pool.

### Key Points:
1. **String Concatenation**: When you concatenate a string (`s1 = s1 + "kranthi";`), Java creates a **new string object** on the heap, and the concatenated result is not interned automatically.
2. **Interning**: The `.intern()` method places the string in the string constant pool, making it reusable and saving memory. After interning, the string `"codekranthi"` will be treated like any other string literal.
3. **Reference Comparison (`==`)**: Even if two strings have the same content, `==` checks if they refer to the same object in memory. After concatenation, `s1` and `s3` point to different objects, so `==` returns `false`. However, after interning, both `s4` and `s3` point to the same object in the pool, so `==` returns `true`.
